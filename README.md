## üë∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is inside?

This project uses the following technologies:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [Victory charts](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/victory)

The UI components were built using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with styling handled by [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Additionally, I incorporated [Victory](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/victory) chart components to display statistics.
